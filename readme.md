## Programme

- The roundtable was divided into two sections: Statements of the discussants (each ~3min) + General discussion about the aims and organisational structure of the SIG.
- We collected important results and talking points live in a digital document. They were published and discussed in the [Google mailing list forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scientific-scripting-languages-in-archaeology).
- The audience participated in the discussion and added very important talking points.
